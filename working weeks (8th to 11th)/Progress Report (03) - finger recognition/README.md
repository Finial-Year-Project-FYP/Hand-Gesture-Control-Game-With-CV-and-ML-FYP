# Real-Time Fingers Counter & Hand Gesture Recognizer with Mediapipe and Python ‚úÖ

Goal of this gist is to recognize ONE, TWO, TREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, YEAH, ROCK, SPIDERMAN and OK. We use the LANDMARKS output of the LandmarkLetterboxRemovalCalculator. This output is a landmark list that contains 21 landmark. In the 02-landmarks.jpg picture below you can see the index of each landmark. Each landmark have x, y and z values. But only x, y values are sufficient for our Goal.

1. THUMB OPEN
2. INDEX/POINTER FINGER OPEN
3. MIDDLE FINGER OPEN
4. RING FINGER OPEN
5. PINKY FINGER OPEN

`For exmaple: thumb is open if the x value of landmark 3 and the x value of landmark 4 are less than x value of landmark 2 else it is close.`
